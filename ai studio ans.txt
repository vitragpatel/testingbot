Okay, let's break down how you can build this automatic notification functionality using Python. This is a great task that combines data analysis, location awareness, and system integration.

Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1. Core Components & Data Requirements:

User Data Store: You need access to:

users: Basic user info (user_id, name, maybe preferences).

user_food_history: Records of past food orders (user_id, restaurant_id, dish_name, cuisine_type, timestamp, location_at_order).

user_service_usage: Records of which services a user has used (user_id, service_type, last_used_timestamp).

user_location: The user's current or last known location (user_id, latitude, longitude, timestamp). This needs to be updated reasonably frequently by the app.

user_device_tokens: To send push notifications (user_id, device_token, device_type (iOS/Android)).

Service Data Store:

services: List of all available services (service_id, service_type (food, transport, etc.), name, description).

restaurants (or service_providers for food): Details about food providers (restaurant_id, name, latitude, longitude, cuisine_types served, menu_highlights, rating).

Technology Stack (Python Focus):

Backend Framework (Optional but helpful): Flask, Django, or FastAPI if you want to build this as a microservice or API.

Database Interaction: SQLAlchemy (ORM), psycopg2 (for PostgreSQL), pymongo (for MongoDB), or your database's specific Python driver.

Data Analysis (Simple): Python's built-in collections.Counter, potentially Pandas if analysis gets complex.

Geospatial Calculations: geopy library (for distance calculations) or use database-native geospatial functions (like PostGIS for PostgreSQL or MongoDB's geospatial queries - recommended for efficiency).

Task Scheduling:

APScheduler: Good for running tasks within a single application process or with persistence.

Celery (with Redis or RabbitMQ): More robust, distributed task queue, suitable for larger scale or if you already use it elsewhere.

Push Notification Sending: Libraries like pyfcm (for Firebase Cloud Messaging) or apns2 (for Apple Push Notifications), or use a unified service like AWS SNS, OneSignal API via the requests library.

2. Workflow & Logic:

You'll likely run a periodic task (e.g., once a day, or perhaps triggered by location change events if your system supports that).

For each active user:
  1. Get User's Current Location. If not available or too old, skip location-based suggestions for this user.
  2. Try Food Suggestion Logic:
     a. Fetch user's recent food order history.
     b. Analyze history to find preferred cuisines/dishes (e.g., most frequent cuisine type).
     c. If preferences found:
        i. Query for nearby restaurants (within X km/miles) that serve those preferred cuisines.
        ii. Rank results (e.g., by distance, rating).
        iii. Select the best match.
        iv. If a good match found:
           - Construct a personalized notification message (e.g., "Craving Italian? [Restaurant Name] is nearby and serves great pasta!").
           - Send notification.
           - Mark user as notified for this type today (to avoid spam).
           - Move to the next user.
  3. If NO food suggestion was sent (either no history, no preferences found, or no suitable nearby restaurants):
     a. Try Unused Service Suggestion Logic:
        i. Fetch list of all available service types.
        ii. Fetch list of service types the user HAS used.
        iii. Find the difference (unused services).
        iv. If unused services exist:
           - Select one (e.g., randomly, or based on general popularity, or based on relevance to location if applicable like 'Clubs nearby').
           - Construct a notification message (e.g., "Did you know you can book transport directly in the app? Give it a try!").
           - Send notification.
           - Mark user as notified for this type today.
           - Move to the next user.

4. Important Considerations & Improvements:

Geospatial Queries: Retrieving all restaurants and calculating distance in Python is inefficient for many restaurants. Use your database's geospatial capabilities (e.g., PostGIS ST_DWithin or MongoDB's $nearSphere).

Scalability: For many users, run the check_and_notify_users function in parallel or distribute the workload using Celery. Query users in batches.

Frequency Control: Implement logic to ensure you don't spam users. Store the last notification timestamp per type (food suggestion, service suggestion) for each user and only send if enough time has passed (e.g., 24 hours, 3 days).

User Preferences: Allow users to opt-out of these notification types in the app settings.

Cold Start: What to do for new users with no history? Suggest generally popular nearby restaurants or focus only on the unused service suggestions initially.

Notification Content: Make messages engaging. Use emojis. Maybe include ratings or specific popular dishes.

A/B Testing: Test different notification messages or triggers.

Error Handling & Logging: Implement robust logging to track successes, failures, and reasons (e.g., no location, no preference, no nearby places, FCM error).

Asynchronous Operations: Sending notifications can be slow. Use asynchronous libraries (asyncio, aiohttp) or task queues (Celery) to avoid blocking the main checking loop.

Privacy: Be transparent about using location data for suggestions.

This detailed breakdown should give you a solid foundation for building your automatic notification system in Python. Remember to adapt the database models, queries, and specific libraries to your existing infrastructure.
